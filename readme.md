# Study repo for Design Patterns with Java

I'm going to use Java as the programming language.

## Strategy Pattern

* "Encapsulate what varies."
* "Program to an Interface, not an Implementation".

### IS-A principle

If ```X``` *is-a* ```Y```, then, ```X``` should inherit from (extend) ```Y```.

### HAS-A principle

If ```X``` extends ```Y```, and each ```Y``` subclass *has-a* ```b``` behavior, then, each ```X``` class should be composed with a ```b``` behavior.
